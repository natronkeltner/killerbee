KillerBee is a Python based framework and tool set for exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  Using KillerBee tools and a compatible IEEE 802.15.4 radio interface, you can eavesdrop on ZigBee networks, replay traffic, attack cryptosystems and much more.  Using the KillerBee framework, you can build your own tools, implement ZigBee fuzzing, emulate and attack end-devices, routers and coordinators and much more.

**Trunk**: Most users, looking for a (fairly) stable and up-to-date release, should check out of the trunk at [http://killerbee.googlecode.com/svn/trunk](http://killerbee.googlecode.com/svn/trunk)
**pyUSB 1.0**: Now supported in trunk (with backwards compatibility to pyUSB 0.x). The branches/pyUSB1 branch has been deprecated.

NEW HARDWARE: River Loop Security LLC, in collaboration with Dartmouth College's Api-Do project, is currently designing/testing custom designed circuit boards, the **Api-Mote v2** that is a hardware interface for KillerBee and is _specifically_ designed for ZigBee sniffing, injection and other research/hacking!
